Ideas:
  1. What slows marbles down more- multiple laps vs longer track lengths?
  2. The impact of John Oliver? Since the host took over the marble races where there any notable changes?
      a. Were marbles faster?
      b. Which team won the most money for charity?
      c. Did viewership increase (requires me to add a column of value for 256 rows so maybe not)
  3. Which the average pole position for each marbles?
